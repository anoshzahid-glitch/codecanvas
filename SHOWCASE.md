# 🎨 CodeCanvas - Project Showcase

## The Problem

Traditional developer portfolios are **boring, static, and forgettable**. 

When a recruiter reviews 50+ portfolios in a day:
- GitHub READMEs all look the same
- Static websites blend together
- Code snippets are just text
- Nothing stands out

**Result:** Amazing developers get overlooked because their presentation doesn't match their skills.

## The Solution: CodeCanvas

A **3D interactive portfolio platform** that makes your code impossible to ignore.
